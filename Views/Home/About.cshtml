            Nursing education in Australia currently teaches undergraduate nursing students’ basic digital literacy skills but is yet to
            implement e-health literacy, such as health informatics, into the undergraduate Bachelor of Nursing curricula.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; color: #808080;">
            The purpose of this project is to:
            <br>
            • To develop a contemporary digital literacy and health informatics skills competency framework which addresses nursing
            students’ digital literacy skills gap.
            <br>
            • Inform educators of curriculum changes required to successfully bridge the knowledge and skills gap related to digital literacy
            and health informatics of the future nurse workforce.
            <br>
            • To equip undergraduate nursing students with the appropriate graduate attributes which prepares them for the digitalised
            workforce.
